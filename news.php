    <p style="color:navy;">Sixty injured in private bus collision</p>
    <p>
    A collision involving two buses in Waskaduwa, Kalutara, has claimed the lives of six people and injured 52 others.

A head-on collision between two private buses on the Dambulla-Kurunegala main road in Panliyadda, Melsiripura yesterday afternoon injured sixty persons and sent them to the hospital.

The two bus drivers, a Buddhist monk, and a Bikkhuni, were among those injured. About 20 individuals were sent to Galewala, Kurunegala, Gokarella, and Dambulla hospitals with significant injuries incurred in the tragedy.

Both buses belonged to the same owner, according to investigations.

One of the buses involved in the accident was traveling from Embilipitiya to Jaffna, while the other was going from Vavuniya to Embilipitiya.
Police believe the two buses were traveling at a high rate of speed and collided while attempting to overtake another vehicle. The passengers, on the other hand, claimed that both drivers, who were friends, were speeding and trying to overtake each other in a race when the accident occurred.

Some passengers claimed that the two drivers had a tendency of often flashing their lights at each other when they crossed paths on the road.



Residents in the area said they heard a big crash and hurried outside to see the two buses collide.

    At least five Sri Lankans were among the 20 bus passengers killed in a traffic accident late Friday night in Saudi Arabia. The victims were killed when the bus they were riding in collided with an incoming truck and erupted into flames near Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Marleen Mohamed, Sri Lanka's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, told the Sunday Times that thorough identification was impossible since the bodies were burned beyond recognition, despite the fact that all of the victims were men.



"It appears that the victims were confined for several minutes inside the burning vehicle." Mr. Marleen explained that the intense fire prohibited rescuers from getting close to the ill-fated bus.
