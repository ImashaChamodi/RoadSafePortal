                <p>High death and injury rates on Sri Lanka's roads are harming the country's economic growth and progress in decreasing poverty and increasing wealth during the last decade. Sri Lanka has twice the global average of yearly road crash deaths per capita.

In high-income countries, the average rate is five times that of the greatest performers.

in the entire world According to available data, there are around 38,000 crashes every year that result in injuries.

There were around 3,000 fatalities and 8,000 serious injuries. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of traffic fatalities.

in the South Asia region, among its immediate neighbors.A recent World Bank Group (WBG) analysis of road safety investment in South Asia indicated a crisis aggravated by rapid expansion in vehicle ownership and the diversity of motorized and nonmotorized traffic of various sizes and speeds, with insufficient protection for the most vulnerable. Sri Lankan vehicle ownership is already high by regional standards, having increased by 67 percent between 2011 and 2018. If the current pattern continues, collision fatalities and injuries will continue to rise unless urgently needed changes are taken.</p>
